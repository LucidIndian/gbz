Gardening By ZIP Code Personal Project.

As I make my way through The Odin Project, instead of building (only) the projects in the course, I want to apply as much of the lessons to building something unique and real! Eventually I want to build a web/mobile app.  

I've decided to build something that's been on my mind for years; a tool that helps gardeners and homeowners manage all of the plants they have.

The stages of this poject will be (roughly):
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Ruby on Rails
- Launch MVP!
