  <h2>More about this project</h2>
    <h3>What is it?</h3>
      <p>It's going be a web app written in Ruby on Rails that allows you 
      to do a few things for your yard/garden, like:</p> 
      <ul>
        <li>Quickly find a pallete of plants based on your preferences 
          and built for your area</li>
        <li>CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) your garden over 
          time, tracking yields or just the pretty pictures 
          your take each season!</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Who's it for?</h3>
      <p>People that want a <strong>killer garden</strong> and 
      have the ability to see possibilities that will be 
      compatible for their yard and their preferences.</p>
    <h3>Why is it being built?</h3>
      <p>To save the world! I'm not too educated, techinically, like, I don't 
      have a degree in horticulture, but I did pass the Master Gardener exam 
      and I did work at a plant nursery for almost 3 years. I knew just enough 
      to see how tech could help us become better gardeners, and better gardening 
      could save the world, really! In particular, gardening is about using the 
      right plants, or, adjusting to the environment at hand; tuning 
      into the seasonal rhythm. Selecting plants that are already 
      antifragile in your area (ZIP code).</p>
