    <h2>More about this project</h2>
      <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>It'll be like an "Old Farmers' Almanac", but personalized 
      for <em>your</em> garden!</p>
        <p>It's going be a web app written in Ruby on Rails that allows you 
      to do a few things for your yard/garden, like:</p> 
        <ul>
         <li>Quickly find a pallete of plants based on your preferences 
          and area</li>
         <li>CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) your garden over 
          time, tracking yields, growthm or just the pretty pictures 
          you capture each season!</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Who's it for?</h3>
      <p>People that want a <strong>killer garden</strong> and 
      to make wiser plant choices.</p>

      <h3>How will people use it?</h3>
        <p>To create your ZIP code garden, you will...</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Enter your email and your garden's ZIP Code</li>
         <li>Create your garden by adding info and plants</li>
         <li>Get smart plant recommendations based on your
          location and preferences.
         </li>
         <li>Enable notifications of key events like
          harvest times, weather warnings, etc.
          </li>
       </ol>

      <h3>Why is it being built?</h3>
        <p>To save the world! I knew just enough 
        to see how tech could help us become better gardeners, and better 
        gardening could save the world, really! In particular, gardening 
        is about selecting plants that are already antifragile in our 
        areas (ZIP codes).</p>
